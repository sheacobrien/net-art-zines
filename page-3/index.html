                <h1>Fashion Statements</h1><p>I would say fashion to me is something that gets me excited for the day. Sometimes the only thing that has me looking forward to tomorrow is the outfit I have planned in my head. It’s also a way for me to feel confident. If I’m going out sometimes and I don’t feel great about my body or my face or my hair but what I have on is something I can control and something that makes me feel confident.</p> <br><p>Fashion is reflection of my identity. It somehow mirrors what I want people to see and also the innermost parts of myself that I cannot explain through words. When I an unable to create I use fashion as a mode of creativity. Looking back and seeing all of my different styles and how they are so deeply intertwined with my identity at the time shows a visual diary of who I was and who I am now.</p> <br><p>Fashion for me isn’t about having the trendiest or most expensive item of the season, it’s about being able to tell when YOU like something aesthetically on someone else or on yourself regardless of what people tell you is “in” or “out” right now. Being strict with your consumption. Buy it nice or buy it twice. Less items that value more. If you don’t love it, you’re probably not going to wear it for long. Hair is one of the greatest accessories. It can change the whole way your outfit is perceived. </p><br><p>Ever since I was very young, fashion has been a creative outlet for me to express myself through styles, colors, patterns and shapes. To this day, a creative outfit lifts my mood!</p><br><p>Fashion creativity has become something really important to me over the last few years. Growing up my mom was pretty restrictive and judgmental on my clothing and what i wanted to wear, so I learned to use clothes as a way to cover up and hide my body. That changed when I got to college and met now some of my closest friends who showed me that clothes can be so much more than hiding. From there I learned to not be afraid to wear clothes that I like without the fear of being judged. I look forward to finding new clothes that embody who I am and want to be. I think fashion can also be used as a political and environmental statement. I am passionate about sourcing my clothing in ethical ways and buying from good companies that care about the climate and their workplace/workers. Fashion has showed me a lot about myself and taught me to love my body. I think the fashion industry still has a long way to go, but I’m thankful for what it’s taught me so far.</p>
